label.continuousLoan =  Loan with payments in geometric progression
label.whatiscontinuousloan = What is a loan by the continuous method?
label.continuousloaninfo =  Increasing instalments (amortization with instalments in geometric progression). In this modality, the calculation of instalments is increasing geometrically according to the percentage of increment established previously. The financing system has been used in the loans of officially protected housing and indicates a suitable financing system for projects in which the investment that has been financed generates increasing cash flows (see figure). The differences between the first and the last instalments in extended periods of time can be very high since the geometric progression is applied from the first instalment.
label.cmi2 = <strong>a1:</strong> Instalment of period 1.
label.cmi3 = <strong>C0:</strong> Borrowed capital.

label.cmi7 = The second instalment would be calculated with the formula <strong> a2 = a1 x 1.0t.</strong> The instalment n would be: <strong> an = an - 1 x 1.0t. </strong>
label.cmi8 = The geometric formula cannot be applied when the value <strong> q </strong> is greater than <strong> (1 + i) </strong> since, in that case, we obtain negative instalments.

label.whatisfrenchloan = What is a French method loan?
label.frenchmethodloaninfo = In this system, capital is increasingly amortized, with interest rates decreasing as a proportion of the progressively lower capital, so that in each period the joint share of capital and interest is identical to that of the rest of the periods.
label.fmi2 = It is a real contract aspayment is essential for the contract to exist and, from that moment, obligations for the borrower are generated. Some of these obligations are: 
label.fmi3 = ‚Ä¢	Paying all the formalization costs.<br>‚Ä¢	Paying the fees for the operation. <br>‚Ä¢	Making the capital repayments within the agreed periods. <br>‚Ä¢	Paying the interests within the agreed periods, as√≠ as well as the interests on arrears that can be generated by late payments.
label.fmi4 = In the French method, the capital amortized increases and the interests decrease in each instalment since the outstanding capital is lower. This way, the amount made up of capital and interests is the same in every period. Its formula is:
label.fmi5 = Being: <br>*a: constant instalments<br>Co: amount of the loan<br>n: number of periods<br>i: interest rate
label.whatisgermanloan = What is a German method loan?
label.germanmethodloaninfo = In this loan type the calculation of the instalments is constant except for the one at the beginning, which corresponds to the amount of the pre-payable interests of the operation. There are, therefore, n + 1 payments, whereas there are only n periods, ranging from zero to n-1 the calculated interests.
label.gmi2 = It is a contract in which the financial firm (moneylender) gives to the client (borrower) an amount of money that has been agreed on, making them repay the amount borrowed with interests according to a payment schedule. The way in which this is made must be specified in the contract.

label.gmi5 = In the German loan, the instalments are constant except for the one at the beginning that corresponds to the amount of the pre-payable interests of the operation. Thus, there are n+1 payments, whereas there are only n payments of interests, that go from the beginning to the n-1 payment. Their formulas are: 
label.gmi6 = Being:<br>a: instalment of the period<br>Co: amount of the loan<br>n: number of periods<br>i: interest rate.
label.whatisitalianloan = What is an Italian method loan?
label.italianmethodloaninfo = In this modality, the loan is amortized in aliquot payments in each period, and the interest is settled by the corresponding outstanding capital, so that the successive installments are decreasing as the interest, period by period, is lower.
label.imi2 = It is a real contract as the payment is an essential element for the contract to exist and, from that moment, obligations for the borrower are generated. Some of these obligations are: 
label.imi3 = ‚Ä¢	Paying all the formalization costs. <br>‚Ä¢	Paying the fees for the operation. <br>‚Ä¢	Making the capital amortizations within the agreed periods. <br>‚Ä¢	Paying the interests within the agreed periods, as well as the interests on arrears that can be generated by late payments
label.imi4 = In the Italian method loan, the capital is amortized in aliquot payments every period, the interests of the outstanding capital of the period being paid off as well. For this reason, the successive instalments are in decline since the interests decrease in every period. Its formula is: 
label.imi5 = Being:<br>a: instalment of the period n<br>c: amount of the loan<br>t: number of periods<br>CVn: outstanding capital of the period n<br>i: per unit<br>dn: days of the period n<br>B: basis for the calculations (360 or 365 days) 
label.whatisamericanloan = What is an American method loan?
label.americanmethodloaninfo = Amortization system through single repayment of capital and periodic payment of interest

label.ami3 = ‚Ä¢	Paying all the formalization costs. <br>‚Ä¢	Paying the fees for the operation. <br>‚Ä¢	Making the capital amortizations within the agreed periods. <br>‚Ä¢	Paying the interests within the agreed periods, as well as the interests on arrears that can be generated by late payments.
label.ami4 = In the American amortization system or system by single amortization and periodic payment of interests, the instalments are calculated as follows: 
label.ami5 = Being:<br>a: instalment of the period<br>Co: amount of the loan<br>n: number of periods<br>i: interest rate.
label.s4frenchlateral = <p style="text-align: justify;">The amortization by the French method, progressive or classic, is characterized by the payment of overdue interest, that is to say, at the end of each payment, and payment of constant instalments in each period.<br> Interest decreases as loan periods pass and amortized capital increases in evey new period.</p>
label.s4italianlateral = <p style="text-align: justify;">Amortization by the Italian method. Its main characteristic is that the amortized capital in each period of time is constant. <br> The instalments and the interests are of descending character and they vary in the same proportion.</p>
label.s4germanlateral = <p style="text-align: justify;">The amortization by the German method is characterized by the payment of the interests at the beginning of each period and constant instalments in each period of time.

The firm, however, does not assume the risk of default of the debtor.
label.s5i9 = In these transactions, a part of the collection rights of the enterprise, that must be duly documented with bills of exchange, promissory notes, bills or receipts, is handed over to a financial firm.

label.s5i10 = The financial firm does not assume the risk of default, that is to say, if the debtor does not pay those bills, the costs are borne by the client.
